# Pathfinding Visualizer

This project is a small webapp written in React + Typsecript that visualizes different graph traversal and pathfinding algorithm. 

The main purpose of this project was to gain experience in React, and also to give me an opportunity to get know these algorithms and understand how each of them works.
